Description 
This analysis delves into Walmart's weekly sales data spanning from February 5, 2010, to October 26, 2012. 
Key metrics were computed to provide insights into sales trends and factors influencing performance. 

The analysis includes calculations for the rolling average sales over a four-week period (equivalent to one month), as well as the weekly growth rate. 

Additionally, the distribution of sales across different stores was examined, alongside correlations between sales and external factors such as temperature, fuel price, CPI (Consumer Price Index), and unemployment rate. 

Furthermore, the impact of holidays on sales was assessed to understand their influence on overall performance. 

By exploring these metrics, this analysis aims to uncover patterns and relationships within the dataset, shedding light on Walmart's sales dynamics during the specified timeframe.
