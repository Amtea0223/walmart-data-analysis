# Walmart Data Analysis

This project aims to analyze Walmart's sales data to gain insights into sales trends and factors influencing performance.

**Data Source:** 

[Walmart Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/walmart-dataset?resource=download)

**Specification:** 

PostgreSQL

**Description:**

The analysis delves into Walmart's weekly sales data spanning from February 5, 2010, to October 26, 2012. It computes key metrics to provide insights into sales trends and factors influencing performance.

The analysis includes calculations for the rolling average sales over a four-week period (equivalent to one month) and the weekly growth rate. It also examines the distribution of sales across different stores and explores correlations between sales and external factors such as temperature, fuel price, CPI (Consumer Price Index), and unemployment rate.

Furthermore, the impact of holidays on sales is assessed to understand their influence on overall performance.

By exploring these metrics, the analysis aims to uncover patterns and relationships within the dataset, shedding light on Walmart's sales dynamics during the specified timeframe.
